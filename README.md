# Orange County forest cover

* Under development * 

The repository contains the R scripts and web app for the study of forest cover in Orange County, NC by the [OC Commission for the Environment](http://www.co.orange.nc.us/803/Commission-for-the-Environment).

The study uses a similar methodology to [i-tree Canopy](https://canopy.itreetools.org/) with the addition of:

* multiple users can record identifications with built-in intra- and inter- rater reliability assessment
* WMS orthoimagery layers are customizable (e.g. different years of the same area)
